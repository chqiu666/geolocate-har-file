## üéÆ Usage

### Basic Operation
1. **Select Model**: Choose a drawing category from the dropdown
2. **Adjust Parameters**: Set temperature, speed, stroke width, and scale
3. **Start Drawing**: Click "Start Drawing" or press SPACE
4. **Control Playback**: Use pause/resume to control the animation
5. **Save Result**: Click "Save Image" to download the drawing

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- **SPACE**: Start/Pause drawing
- **C**: Clear canvas
- **R**: Generate random drawing

### Parameter Guidelines
- **Low Temperature (0.1-0.3)**: More predictable, typical drawings
- **Medium Temperature (0.4-0.6)**: Balanced creativity and structure
- **High Temperature (0.7-1.0)**: More creative, unpredictable results

- **Scale Factor**: Adjust based on canvas size and desired detail level
- **Drawing Speed**: Higher speeds for quick previews, lower for detailed observation

## üîç Technical Notes

### Model Information
- Models are pre-trained on Google's Quick, Draw! dataset
- Each model is specific to one drawing category
- Models use LSTM architecture for sequence generation
- Stroke data is normalized and scaled appropriately

### Canvas Scaling
- Proper scaling ensures drawings fit within the canvas
- Pixel factor accounts for different display densities
- Drawing scale allows real-time size adjustments

### State Management
- Comprehensive tracking of drawing state
- RNN hidden states are properly maintained
- UI updates are synchronized with drawing progress
